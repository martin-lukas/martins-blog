    <h1>MacRemote - Control your laptop from your phone</h1>

    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>Have a way to control my laptop remotely in some limited capacity.</p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      My "Smart" TV has Netflix and other streaming platform apps, but some
      content that I want to watch is not available there. That's when I usually
      fetch my MacBook laptop, and connect it via HDMI to the TV.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the cable is quite short, so I usually set everything up for
      watching, start the content, and stash the laptop under the TV. But when I
      want to pause it, or go a bit forward/backward, I have to get up from the
      sofa, and go open the laptop. As you can imagine, that gets annoying.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could get a bluetooth keyboard and control it that way, but that's also
      not ideal (bulky keyboard, battery could run out, have to make sure it's
      connected, etc.).
    </p>
  </body>
  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <p>
    I decided to go the hard way about this. I want to create an app running on
    the laptop, and listening for requests from over the network. Then I just
    open a web UI on my phone, and start controlling the laptop by sending some
    requests. The app running on the laptop then performs actions based on the
    incoming requests.
  </p>
  <p>
    You could object - there are existing apps that do similar things, and
    probably much more powerful. And you're probably right. However, I want the
    UI to be really simple, so I can easily control it in the dark, and have big
    buttons for the commonly used actions, like pausing the movie, or changing
    the volume. You know, kinda like a TV remote. There probably are tools that
    would do exactly that, but I don't mind creating my own, especially if I'll
    enjoy the process itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    So let's start. First I need to create a simple web server that can listen
    to requests. I chose these technologies:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Language: Scala</li>
    <li>Libraries: Http4s, Cats Effect</li>
  </ul>
  <pre><code>
    import cats.effect.*
    import org.http4s.server.blaze.*

    object Server extends IOApp.Simple {
      override def run: IO[Unit] =
        BlazeServerBuilder[IO]
          .bindHttp(8050, "0.0.0.0")
          .withHttpApp(MediaController.routes.orNotFound)
          .serve
          .compile
          .drain    
    }
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    The bound IP address <code>0.0.0.0</code> allows for the server to listen on
    both the IP for the local network, as well as localhost, for local
    development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next, I'll create the controller for handling media actions
    <code>MediaController</code>:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    import cats.effect.*
    import org.http4s.*
    import org.http4s.dsl.io.*
    import org.http4s.headers.`Content-Type`
    import org.http4s.MediaType
    import scala.io.Source

    object MediaController {
      val routes: HttpRoutes[IO] = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
        case GET -> Root / "media" / subPath =>
          subPath match {
            case "ui" =>
              val html = Source.fromResource("index.html")
                .getLines
                .mkString("\n")
              Ok(html).map(_.withContentType(
                `Content-Type`(MediaType.text.html, Charset.`UTF-8`)
              ))
            case "maximize" =>
              triggerKeysAndComplete("F")
            case "pause" =>
              triggerKeysAndComplete("SPACE")
            case "volumeup" =>
              triggerKeysAndComplete("UP")
            case "volumedown" =>
              triggerKeysAndComplete("DOWN")
            case "forward" =>
              triggerKeysAndComplete("RIGHT")
            case "backward" =>
              triggerKeysAndComplete("LEFT")
            case _ =>
              NotFound("Page not found")
          }
      }
    
      private def triggerKeysAndComplete(keys: String*) = {
        // TODO: trigger key events in the OS
        NoContent()
      }
    }    
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    These actions are the ones I need the most frequently. Maybe in time, I'll
    add some more.
  </p>
  <p>
    The UI itself will run at <code>/media/ui</code>, as you can see from the
    first endpoint.
  </p>
  <p>
    What's left is the service that can trigger these actions in the OS. I've
    made this program specifically for MacOS, so I'll call the class
    <code>AppleScript</code>:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    import scala.sys.process.*

    object AppleScript {
      def triggerKeys(keys: List[String]): Int = {
        keys match {
          case List("F") =>
            execute("""tell application "System Events" to keystroke "f"""")
          case List("SPACE") =>
            execute("""tell application "System Events" to keystroke space""")
          case List("LEFT") =>
            execute("""tell application "System Events" to key code 123""")
          case List("RIGHT") =>
            execute("""tell application "System Events" to key code 124""")
          case List("DOWN") =>
            execute("""tell application "System Events" to key code 125""")
          case List("UP") =>
            execute("""tell application "System Events" to key code 126""")
          case _ =>
            throw new Exception(s"Unsupported keys were triggered: ${keys.mkString(", ")}")
        }
      }
    
      private def execute(script: String): Int =
        Seq("osascript", "-e", script).!
    }
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Now all that's left is to replace the TODO in the previous file with a call
    to this class:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    private def triggerKeysAndComplete(keys: String*) = {
      triggerKeys(keys.toList)
      NoContent()
    }
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    I won't describe the UI itself in detail, it's just a couple of buttons with
    some styling sprinkled on top, and each button sends a simple GET request to
    the server. The current state of the UI:
  </p>
  <img src="/assets/images/mac-remote-ui.png" alt="MacRemote UI" />
  <p>
    I admit, the UI is a bit crude. But that wasn't the focus for me. I mainly
    focused on having big buttons, and not being too disturbed by a bright
    screen when watching TV.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last piece of the puzzle was to make this server run automatically on
    startup, so the UI would be always available anytime I want to connect my
    laptop to the TV, without thinking about it. In my case, I chose the app
    Automator, that comes with the OS.
