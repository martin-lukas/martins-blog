    <h1>MacRemote - Control your laptop from your phone</h1>

    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>Have a way to control my laptop remotely in some limited capacity.</p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      My "Smart" TV has Netflix and other streaming platform apps, but some
      content that I want to watch is not available there. That's when I usually
      fetch my MacBook laptop, and connect it via HDMI to the TV.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the cable is quite short, so I usually set everything up for
      watching, start the content, and stash the laptop under the TV. But when I
      want to pause it, or go a bit forward/backward, I have to get up from the
      sofa, and go open the laptop. As you can imagine, that gets annoying.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could get a bluetooth keyboard and control it that way, but that's also
      not ideal (bulky keyboard, battery could run out, have to make sure it's
      connected, etc.).
    </p>

  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <p>
    I decided to go the hard way about this. I want to create an app running on
    the laptop, and listening for requests from over the network. Then I just
    open a web UI on my phone, and start controlling the laptop by sending some
    requests. The app running on the laptop then performs actions based on the
    incoming requests.
  </p>
  <p>
    You could object - there are existing apps that do similar things, and
    probably much more powerful. And you're probably right. However, I want the
    UI to be really simple, so I can easily control it in the dark, and have big
    buttons for the commonly used actions, like pausing the movie, or changing
    the volume. You know, kinda like a TV remote. There probably are tools that
    would do exactly that, but I don't mind creating my own, especially if I'll
    enjoy the process itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    So let's start. First I need to create a simple web server that can listen
    to requests. I chose these technologies:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Language: Scala (learning it for work)</li>
    <li>Libraries: Http4s, Cats Effect</li>
  </ul>
