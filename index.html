# Welcome to Martin's Tech Blog

Here I'll write about my journey through studying various new technologies. Currently I'm interested in:

- Rust (and how to write memory-safe code)
- containerization (learning Docker)
- cloud deployment (some AWS services)
- React libraries (Next.js, React Query, Styled Components)

I'd like to share my progress in all these, and write down my wins and struggles in them.
