# Learning Styled Components with React

I've never been a big fan of tinkering with CSS. It was always a struggle to try to achieve a pixel-perfect design of the app, and the process wasn't satisfying at all. In the backend, it always felt more satisfying to improve the existing architecture, or fix some issues in the logic. If I fixed some styling issues on the frontend, usually it led to an even more complicated CSS file. But that's probably mostly from lack of experience with it.

But today I'll try to  rewrite the basic Todo app's CSS into a cleaner Styled Components solution, while preserving the current design.

## The example app

I'll be trying Styled Components with an example Todo app I prepared. The app looks something like this:

My main goal is to not break the app when trying to fit in the Styled Components.
